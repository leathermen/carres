This is the visual part of the project.

> Remember, this is not the primary project here. This project was created only to make the whole idea viable. It's not guaranteed to contain best practices and code quality pinnacles.

## Ideas

It's an SSR frontend app that includes the authentication. The authentication is stateless and works on top of JWT token concept.
The app tends to be simple and easy to maintain. I did not spend much time creating it, though I am new to Svelte.

## Created with

It's built upon a pure SvelteKit installation: `npm create svelte@latest`. Then some extensions were applied. Also I use Tailwind CSS as a way to boost the UI creation.
